### Installation steps

#### 1. Clone Github Repository to your local machine

Let's assume `/var/www/html/` is the root directory of your webserver:

    cd /var/www/html/
    git clone https://github.com/misaflo/bbb-usage
    composer update # install bigbluebutton-api-php

#### 2. Create mySQL database

Creata a new database `bbb-usage` and grant access to a user

#### 3. Adopt bbb-usage configuration

#### 4. Add crontab job

It's recommended to collect data every 5 minutes:

`*/5 * * * * cd /var/www/html/bbb-usage && /usr/bin/php /var/www/html/bbb-usage/collect.php`
